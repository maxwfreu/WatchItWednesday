  'tt0448011': `Mysterious time capule? Ultimate catastrophe? Nick Cage himself? What doesn't this movie have? I guarantee you'll be pretty interested for the most part. Id say the level of attention required in this one is about a 4PM on a Friday if you catch my drift. Yeah, you're working, but you've got other things on your mind.`,
  'tt0417433': `Most movies that include a synopsis about a someone from the 'wrong side of the tracks' is a story that has been told a million times. I had my mom read me Goodnight Moon every for years as a child. Why? Because it was consistent. I knew when she opened that marvelous novel I would see that beautiful space cow jumping over the moon. This movie is no different. James Franco is a beautiful space cow.`,
  'tt0120591': `Alright, this movie is secretely one of my favorites. That being said, I've had this on as background noise countless times only to zone back in for a Bruce Willis montage of badassery and explosions. If action is your thing, but you still wanna browse memes and stalk your ex, then this is the perfect backround melody.`,
  'tt0338466': `Well I haven't seen this one in years, but I have a distinct memory of watching this and going 'Eh, yeah ok'. The movie critic in me wanted to say it was awful, but I never turned it off. How low have I stooped that my benchmark for acceptable is that I simply didn't turn the TV off? Pretty damn low. Need something that too good to be bad but too bad to be good? This is exactly that`,
  'tt0478087': `Yeah I mean you really get what you ask for with this one. Before watching this, just try and imagine everything that would happpen given the synopsis about. Got it? Yeah - pretty much exactly that happens. How can you be let down if you know whats going to happen? You can't. This movie won't let you down, and I won't either.`,
